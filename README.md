# Leetcode algorithm in Python

## Overview
### Welcome to my personal repository of LeetCode algorithm solutions. 
This repository contains solutions to various algorithmic problems from LeetCode, covering topics such as:

- Arrays
- Dynamic Programming
- Graphs
- Linked Lists
- And more.

### The goal of this repository is to:

- Track my progress.
- Share my approach to solving problems.
- Help others by providing well-documented solutions.

## Structure

The repository is organized by the problem number and problem title from LeetCode. Each problem folder contains the
following:

* Solution File: The code solution to the problem.
* Explanation: A detailed explanation of the approach and solution, including time complexity and space complexity
  analysis.
* Test Cases: Some example test cases used for validating the solution.
